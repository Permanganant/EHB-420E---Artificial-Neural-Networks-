What happens is that when one does calculations over and over again the error percentage increase per process because of the bit limitation. In this code, when one calculated the square root of a function, very little error percentage occurs as a result. After that, when one tries to get the second power of the number, the error occurs again with the previous error. As a result, error increases gradually.*\n"

Also, if the input argument is not a non-negative integer, it prints an error message on the screen and asks the user to re-enter a non-negative integer number. Also, when it is done with finding the requested Fibonacci number, it asks again the user to either input a new non-negative integer, or enter ‘stop’ to end the function, like the following,"
